('Betelgeuse', 'Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star located in the constellation Orion. It is one of the brightest stars in the night sky and is visible to the naked eye, particularly in the winter months. Betelgeuse marks the shoulder of the hunter in the Orion constellation and is a prominent and well-known celestial object. Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star, which means that it is a large, luminous star that is approaching the end of its life. It is located about 640 light-years from Earth and is one of the largest and most luminous stars known to exist. Betelgeuse is so large that if it were placed at the center of our solar system, it would extend beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Despite its size and brightness, Betelgeuse is a relatively cool star, with a surface temperature of about 3,500 degrees Celsius. This is much cooler than our sun, which has a surface temperature of about 5,500 degrees Celsius. Overall, Betelgeuse is a fascinating and important star to study. Its size, brightness, and location make it an important object for astronomers and a popular target for observations.', 'https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/62f7ab7589ab47e610750efd/The-red-supergiant-Betelgeuse-is-the-ninth-brightest-star-in-the-night-sky-/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1453,681,x958,y951,safe&width=960'),
('Rigel', 'Rigel is a blue supergiant star located in the constellation Orion. It is the seventh brightest star in the night sky and is visible to the naked eye, particularly in the winter months. Rigel marks the foot of the hunter in the Orion constellation and is a prominent and well-known celestial object. Rigel is a blue supergiant star, which means that it is a large, luminous star that is approaching the end of its life. It is located about 773 light-years from Earth and is one of the largest and most luminous stars known to exist. Rigel is so large that if it were placed at the center of our solar system, it would extend beyond the orbit of Saturn. Despite its size and brightness, Rigel is a relatively hot star, with a surface temperature of about 12,000 degrees Celsius. This is much hotter than our sun, which has a surface temperature of about 5,500 degrees Celsius. Overall, Rigel is a fascinating and important star to study. Its size, brightness, and location make it an important object for astronomers and a popular target for observations.', 'https://earthsky.org/upl/2020/01/rigel-astropixels-Fred-Espenak-800.png'),
('Bellatrix', 'Bellatrix, also known as Gamma Orionis, is a blue-white giant star located in the constellation Orion. It is the third-brightest star in Orion and one of the brightest stars in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.64. Bellatrix is located about 240 light-years away from Earth. It is a hot, massive star, with a surface temperature of around 29,000 degrees Celsius and a mass of around 8.5 times that of the Sun. Bellatrix is a B-type star, which means it is relatively young and still undergoing nuclear fusion in its core. It is classified as a Beta Cephei variable, which means it pulsates periodically, causing its brightness to vary slightly over time.', 'https://astrologyking.com/wp-content/uploads/bellatrix-star-gamma-orionis.jpg'),
('Alnilam', 'Alnilam, also known as Epsilon Orionis, is a blue supergiant star located in the constellation Orion. It is the central star in the "belt" of Orion and one of the brightest stars in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.70. Alnilam is located about 1,300 light-years away from Earth. It is a hot, massive star, with a surface temperature of around 30,000 degrees Celsius and a mass of around 30 times that of the Sun. Alnilam is a B-type star, which means it is relatively young and still undergoing nuclear fusion in its core. It is classified as a Luminous Blue Variable, which means it is prone to sudden changes in brightness and is surrounded by a nebula of gas and dust. Alnilam is also a star with a high mass-loss rate, meaning that it is losing mass at a rapid rate due to powerful winds emanating from its surface.', 'https://www.astronomytrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Alnilam.jpg'),
('Alnitak', 'Alnitak, also known as Zeta Orionis, is a triple star system located in the constellation Orion. It is the easternmost star in Orion''s belt and one of the brightest stars in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.74. Alnitak is located about 800 light-years away from Earth. The primary star in the system is a blue supergiant star with a surface temperature of around 30,000 degrees Celsius and a mass of around 20 times that of the Sun. It is classified as an O-type star, which means it is extremely hot and luminous. The two companion stars are both hot, blue-white stars with masses of around 10 times that of the Sun. Alnitak is surrounded by a nebula of gas and dust, which is visible in telescopes as a faint, glowing cloud. The nebula is thought to be created by the intense radiation and winds emanating from the primary star.', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Ngc2024_2mass.jpg'),
('Mintaka', 'Mintaka, also known as Delta Orionis, is a multiple star system located in the constellation Orion. It is the westernmost star in Orion''s belt and one of the brightest stars in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 2.21. Mintaka is located about 900 light-years away from Earth. The primary star in the system is a blue-white giant star with a surface temperature of around 28,000 degrees Celsius and a mass of around 20 times that of the Sun. It is classified as an O-type star, which means it is extremely hot and luminous. The two companion stars are both hot, blue-white stars with masses of around 10 times that of the Sun. Mintaka is surrounded by a nebula of gas and dust, which is visible in telescopes as a faint, glowing cloud.
